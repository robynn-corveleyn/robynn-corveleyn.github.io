        I am currently a PhD student at <a href= "https://www.uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/irmp/group-theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Université Catholique de Louvain</a>, working in group theory under the supervision of 
        <a href="https://perso.uclouvain.be/timothee.marquis/intro.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Timothée Marquis</a>.

        My research interests lie within geometric group theory, with a particular focus on <b> Kac-Moody groups and Kac-Moody algebras, buildings, and Coxeter groups</b>. I am also very interested in representation theory, particularly in the representation theory of (totally disconnected) locally compact groups, and in (units of) integral group rings.

        Besides research, I am committed to outreach initiatives to promote mathematics, and to improving equity, inclusion and diversity in mathematics and STEM. A description of the main activities I organise/have organised, may be found in the "Outreach" tab, while a full list of all initiatives I have participated in may be found on my CV.
